<h3>HOW TO PLAY</h3>

<h6>Click images of NBA players in order to earn points. Don't click the same card twice!</h6>

More Info:
This is a simple memory game written in React. The game will track each clicked image a user makes. If the same image is clicked twice the game will be reset. Each correct click increments the users score by 1.
